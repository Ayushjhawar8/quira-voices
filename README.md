**Listen from Rohan Sharma (Ex Community Moderator & Developer Advocate):**

I'm Rohan Sharma. Your cutest, sweetest, handsome, and most charming moderator of [Quira Discord Community](https://discord.gg/GbryCwUgfV).

I wanted to thank you. Quira have been one of the biggest reasons I‚Äôve grown so much in my career. I‚Äôve learned a lot from Quira community. I really hope I didn‚Äôt annoy anyone too much along the way üòÖ

As we all know, nothing lasts forever (well‚Ä¶ except maybe those F*** tardigrades). Every good thing comes to an end. Yes, I‚Äôm sad, but I‚Äôm even more grateful that I got the chance to be part of something this fantastic, wonderful and beatiful.

Quira was like my second home, and every member here was family. I‚Äôm going to miss you all a lot. Keep growing, keep winning, and I‚Äôll be cheering for your success from wherever I am. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Once again, thank you for being part of this family, it truly means the world to me.
