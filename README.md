**Listen from Rohan Sharma (Ex Community Moderator & Developer Advocate):**

> I'm Rohan Sharma. Your cutest, sweetest, handsome, and most charming moderator of [Quira Discord Community](https://discord.gg/GbryCwUgfV).

> I wanted to thank you. Quira have been one of the biggest reasons I’ve grown so much in my career. I’ve learned a lot from Quira community. I really hope I didn’t annoy anyone too much along the way 😅
> 
> As we all know, nothing lasts forever (well… except maybe those F*** tardigrades). Every good thing comes to an end. Yes, I’m sad, but I’m even more grateful that I got the chance to be part of something this fantastic, wonderful and beatiful.
> 
> Quira was like my second home, and every member here was family. I’m going to miss you all a lot. Keep growing, keep winning, and I’ll be cheering for your success from wherever I am. ❤️
